### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nicole from Indiana.  I have a professional background in training and journalism.  I am looking to leverage these skills to become a technical writer.  I'm a lifetime learner and currently learning various, desktop publishing systems.  I'm looking to build a portfolio of work for technical writing.  Please send me an email at nicolewoodard14@gmail.com if you think I could help with your project.
